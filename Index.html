<body>
    <H1>Have you ever tried to make pizza from scratch?</H1>
    <H2>Yeah, but have you really thought aboyt it?</H2>
    <h3>Like, how if you put the sauce on first, before you make the base that it doesnt work</h3>
    <h4>or, if you put the cheese on and then the sauce its messed up too?</h4>
    
    <p class="special">making a pizza is similar to coding, there are certain things we have to do first.
    Like making the base, letting it rise, mould the base out, add the sauce, add the toppings,
    add the cheese, bake, and cut and serve. Not all pizzas are the same, but they do start out in
    the same way as long as you follow the order correctly. You can have everything you need to 
    make many different pizzas using the same base structure that is set up before hand.</p>
